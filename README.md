# Medical Insurance Cost Predictor

## Overview
The Medical Insurance Cost Predictor is a machine learning project designed to estimate the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By leveraging regression models, this project helps users predict potential insurance expenses with improved accuracy.

## Features
- Predicts medical insurance costs using machine learning models.
- Utilizes regression techniques for accurate predictions.
- Supports various input parameters including age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.
- User-friendly interface for data input and cost estimation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Flask (For Web Deployment - optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (For experimentation)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following attributes:
- Age: The age of the individual.
- Sex: Gender of the individual.
- BMI: Body Mass Index.
- Children: Number of dependents.
- Smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker or not.
- Region: The region where the individual resides.
- Charges: The actual insurance cost (target variable).

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-predictor.git
   cd medical-insurance-predictor
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation:
 
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Train the machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
3. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (MSE, R-squared, etc.).
4. Deploy the model using Flask or another web framework (optional).

## Model Performance
The project evaluates different regression models and compares their accuracy using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared scores. The best-performing model is selected for deployment.

## Future Improvements
- Improve prediction accuracy with advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Implement a web-based UI for user interaction.
- Expand dataset with additional features for better predictions.
